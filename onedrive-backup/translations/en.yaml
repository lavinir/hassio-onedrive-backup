Files are stored under a new directory called "FileSync" under the App Folder root. Source folder structure is maintained under this folder.
                Sync (sub)folders supported must be under one of the following roots: /config, /ssl, /share, /media, /addons
                You can specify an array of items here containing "path" and "recursive".

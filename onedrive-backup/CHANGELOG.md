## v2.3.7 [December 8th 2024] (Preview Channel)
### 🆕 Added  
* Additional debugging logs

## v2.3.6 [November 24th 2024]
### 🐞 Fixed
* Backups File Upload Failures - Removed dependency on OneDrive File descriptions that seem to have been causing many Upload failures for some users. The metadata for the OneDrive Backups will now be stored locally instead


## v2.3.5 [November 20th 2024]
### ❗Important
The OneDrive Entra App was created as a Multi Tenant app (to enable future Business account support). Earlier this month due to a new MS policy, these apps required Verified Publishers (Microsoft Partners) otherwise it will not allow users to grant consent. I've updated the App to only allow Personal Accounts. This also required code changes. Please make sure authentication goes through properly after the update and if you have any issues with this please consolidate them around the [opened Github issue]("https://github.com/lavinir/hassio-onedrive-backup/issues/247)

### 🐞 Fixed
* Authentication / Permissions issue 
* Continous backup upload / delete loop in certain edge cases with Generational Backups enabled

### 🗑️ Removed
* Free Space Sensor - Turns out getting the Available free space in OneDrive requires Read All permissions on the OneDrive account. I didn't notice this was happening with my account but this could prompt for additional consent when the App makes the API call. Unfortunately having The app run with these extended permissions is something I wasn't willing to do since the beginning and regretably I've removed this feature currently. 

## v2.3.1 [March 19th 2024]
### ❗Important
Upgrade to Version 2.3 included updates to authentication libraries which caused some connection resets with OneDrive. Please make sure that you have a working connection post upgrade. For troubleshooting please refer to [this link]("https://github.com/lavinir/hassio-onedrive-backup/issues/174")

Been a while, this is a pretty big release 🎉. Please make sure you read the Breaking Changes before upgrade.

### ❗Breaking 
* All configuration options have been moved from Home Assistant to the addon itself. The addon will attempt to migrate the old settings but if this fails, settings will be reverted to defaults! Make sure you go over all settings after upgrading.

### 🆕 Added  
* Generational Backups! You can now set backup retention policy to Generational (days, weeks, months, years). See README for full details.
* As mentioned above, all settings are now done through the Addon UI instead of Home Assistant. No need for restarting the addon when modifying settings.
* Ignore Allowed Hours for File Sync - Added option to allow File Syncing to occur all day and only have backups follow the Allowed Hours settings.
* Optional Telemetry - I've added an optional Opt-In option that sends anonymous configuration telemetry for which features are enabled to better help me focus on most used features. Full details in the README. (disabled by default)

### 🐞 Fixed
* File Sync Deletions - Fixed a bug where files synced would be deleted immediately after they were uploaded.
